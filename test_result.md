# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      Bible Chat MVP completed (Phases 1-4C). 
      Backend: Scripture corpus (15 passages EN/RU), RAG with OpenAI GPT-4o (network issue - fallback works), Chat + Scripture endpoints tested with curl.
      Frontend: Onboarding, Home (Daily Verse), Chat (citations + teaser limit), Passage Viewer, Subscription Paywall (IAP wired).
      
      Testing priorities:
      1. Backend API smoke tests (scripture, daily-verse, chat endpoints)
      2. Citation parsing (EN/RU regex)
      3. Note: Frontend testing limited due to web preview issues (import.meta) - native device needed for full IAP testing
      
      Known limitations:
      - OpenAI API network issue (fallback responses work)
      - Web preview not working (native focus)
      - IAP requires physical device + Sandbox account
      
      Please test backend endpoints first, then provide report.

      - Daily Verse RU: Псалом 23:1-4 Russian Synodal ✅
      - John 3:16 EN: KJV text correct ✅
      - John 3:16 RU: Russian Synodal text correct ✅
      - Philippians 4:6-7 EN: KJV text correct ✅
      
      **Chat Endpoint RAG Pipeline (3/3 PASS):**
      - Fear question EN: Returns fallback with proper structure (answer, citations, has_reliable_sources) ✅
      - Fear question RU: Returns Russian fallback with 3 relevant passages (Иоанна 3:16, Псалом 23:1-4, Филиппийцам 4:6-7) ✅
      - Nonsense input: Correctly sets has_reliable_sources=false, returns polite refusal ✅
      
      **Edge Cases (2/2 PASS):**
      - Invalid reference: Returns 404 as expected ✅
      - Empty body: Returns 422 validation error as expected ✅
      
      **Citation Parser Unit Tests (7/7 PASS):**
      - All unit tests passed for EN/RU citation parsing, validation, and duplicate handling ✅
      
      **Known Issue (Expected):**
      - OpenAI API network connectivity issue confirmed - fallback responses working correctly
      - This is acceptable for MVP as fallback mechanism is robust
      
      **Backend Health: EXCELLENT**
      All core functionality working as designed. No critical issues found.
